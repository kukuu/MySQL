The 15 Commandments!
1.	Proper use of indexes improve performance
2.	Do not perform calculations on an index (eg: if you have an index for a column called salary, do not perform calculation such as salary * 2 > 10000)
3.	“LOAD DATA INFILE” is the fastest way to insert data into MySQL database (20 times faster than normal inserts)
4.	Use INSERT LOW PRIORITY or INSERT DELAYED if you want to delay inserts from happening until the table is free
5.	Use TRUNCATE TABLE rather than DELETE FROM if you are deleting an entire table (DELETE FROM delete row by row, whereas TRUNCATE TABLE deletes all at once)
6.	Always use EXPLAIN to examine if your select query is efficient
7.	Use OPTIMIZE TABLE to reclaim unused space (Note: Table will be locked during optimization, so only do it during low traffic time), and ANALYZE to trigger key distribution of queries.
8.	Better to have 10 quick queries than 1 slow one
9.	Use caching to reduce database load
10.	Normalize tables to ensure data consistency
11.	Use persistent connections
12.	Don’t query columns you don’t need, avoid using SELECT * FROM 
13.	MySQL can search on prefix of indexes (ie: If you have index INDEX (a,b), you don’t need an index on (a)). Leftmost prefixing
14.	Don’t use HAVING when you can use WHERE
15.	Use numeric values rather than alphabetical values when performing a join.
